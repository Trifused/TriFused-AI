Great question! Here's what your AI agent should do to maximize value and align with your site's current weaknesses:

## 🎯 Core Agent Capabilities (Based on Your Site Issues)

### 1. **Content Intelligence Agent**
Since you have the client-side rendering issue, create an agent that:
- **Generates SEO-optimized content** with proper keyword density (solving your 25% "trifused" problem)
- **Creates structured data** (JSON-LD schemas) for your services
- **Writes meta descriptions** and Open Graph content
- **Suggests content improvements** based on search intent

### 2. **Technical SEO Assistant**
- **Audits pages** for the issues in your report
- **Generates noscript fallbacks** automatically
- **Creates/updates sitemaps** dynamically
- **Monitors keyword density** and warns when it's too high

### 3. **AI Discovery & Integration Agent**
Since you have an MCP endpoint, make it powerful:
- **Service catalog** - Let AI agents discover your tech services
- **Project estimator** - AI can get quotes/estimates for users
- **Tech stack advisor** - Recommend solutions based on user needs
- **Status checker** - Query project status, timelines, availability

## 🚀 Innovative Ideas for TriFused

Given you're "AI-Native Technology Services," your agent should showcase this:

### **"Tech Consultant AI"**
```javascript
tools: [
  {
    name: "analyze_tech_stack",
    description: "Analyze a user's current tech stack and recommend improvements"
  },
  {
    name: "estimate_project",
    description: "Get time/cost estimates for web development projects"
  },
  {
    name: "get_case_studies",
    description: "Retrieve relevant case studies based on industry/tech"
  }
]
```

### **"AI Readiness Scanner"** (Meta! 🤯)
- Help other businesses improve *their* AI readiness score
- Analyze their sites like your grader tool did for yours
- Provide actionable recommendations

### **"Smart Contact Agent"**
- Qualify leads automatically
- Route inquiries to right team members
- Schedule consultations
- Answer common technical questions

## 💡 What Makes a GREAT AI Agent?

1. **Solves a real problem** - Not just a chatbot, but actually completes tasks
2. **Uses your unique data** - Your case studies, pricing, availability
3. **Reduces friction** - Makes it easier to work with you than competitors
4. **Collects intelligence** - Learns what prospects need
5. **Always available** - 24/7 qualification and support

## 🎬 My Recommendation

Start with a **"TriFused Tech Advisor"** that:
1. Assesses visitor's tech needs via conversation
2. Recommends your services that fit
3. Provides ballpark estimates
4. Books consultation calls
5. Answers technical questions about your stack/approach

This would be immediately valuable AND showcase your AI-native capabilities to prospects.
