### [CONTENT-ACCESSIBILITY] Very little content in initial HTML (likely client-side rendered) (critical)
**Impact:** AI crawlers may not be able to extract meaningful content
**Fix:** Implement SSR or include critical content in initial HTML response

### [CONTENT-ACCESSIBILITY] No <noscript> fallback content (important)
**Impact:** Users and crawlers without JavaScript see nothing useful

<noscript>
  <p>This site requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript or visit our sitemap.</p>
  <a href="/sitemap">View Sitemap</a>
</noscript>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company",
  "url": "https://trifused.com",
  "description": "Your company description"
}
</script>
