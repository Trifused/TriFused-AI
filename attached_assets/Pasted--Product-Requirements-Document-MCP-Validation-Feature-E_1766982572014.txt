# Product Requirements Document: MCP Validation Feature

## Executive Summary

Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) validation capabilities to the existing SEO testing tool to help clients prepare their websites for AI agent interactions and ensure compatibility with emerging AI standards.

## Problem Statement

Current SEO tools focus on traditional search engine optimization but don’t address the growing need for websites to be accessible and usable by AI agents, LLMs, and automated systems using the Model Context Protocol. As MCP adoption increases, clients need validation tools to ensure their sites are AI-ready.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals

- Extend SEO validation tool to include MCP compliance testing
- Provide actionable insights for AI-readiness
- Future-proof client websites for AI agent interactions
- Differentiate from competitors with cutting-edge validation

### Success Metrics

- 80% of existing users adopt MCP validation within 3 months
- Average validation score improvement of 30% after recommendations
- 50% reduction in AI crawlability issues for clients
- Positive user feedback on actionable recommendations

## User Stories

**As a web developer**, I want to validate my site’s MCP compliance so that AI agents can properly interact with my content.

**As a marketing manager**, I want to understand if my website is ready for AI-driven search and discovery tools.

**As a technical SEO specialist**, I want comprehensive reports showing both traditional SEO and AI-readiness metrics in one tool.
