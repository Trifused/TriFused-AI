Got it — you want a **PRD**. Here’s a clean, practical **Product Requirements Document** for what you’ve been describing. You can drop this straight into GitHub, Notion, or a pitch deck.

# **PRD: TrifusedAI Website Health & Report Card API**

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** TrifusedAI
**Type:** API-first Website Health & Deployment Report Card Service
**Audience:**

* Vibe-coding platforms
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
* AI agents / LLM build tools
* Solo devs, teams, agencies

**Problem Statement:**
Developers and AI-assisted build tools lack a **simple, neutral, API-based “final check”** that evaluates a deployed website holistically (performance, security, SEO, accessibility, headers, best practices) and returns a **single actionable score** that can be used as a deployment gate.

**Solution:**
TrifusedAI provides a **machine-callable website report card API** that returns a standardized score and findings, designed to be embedded directly into build and deployment workflows.

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

* Provide a **fast post-deployment health check**
* Be **CI/CD friendly** (curl-first, JSON-first)
* Be **platform-agnostic** (Replit, GitHub, Jenkins, any “vibe” platform)
* Offer **clear scoring + actionable output**
* Enable **usage-based licensing** with guardrails

### Non-Goals

* Not a visual analytics dashboard (optional later)
* Not a replacement for Lighthouse or deep manual audits
* Not a long-running crawler or scanner

---

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 API Endpoint

**Endpoint:**

```
POST /v1/score
```

**Inputs:**

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "mode": "quick | full",
  "environment": "dev | staging | prod"
}
```

**Authentication:**

* API Key via header

```
Authorization: Bearer TRIFUSED_API_KEY
```

---

### 3.2 Output Schema

```json
{
  "score": 92,
  "grade": "A",
  "categories": {
    "performance": 88,
    "security": 95,
    "seo": 90,
    "accessibility": 100,
    "best_practices": 87
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "category": "security",
      "severity": "important",
      "message": "Missing Content-Security-Policy header",
      "recommendation": "Add a CSP header to reduce XSS risk"
    }
  ],
  "deployment_gate": "pass",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:22:00Z"
}
```

---

## 4. Usage Model & Limits

### Free Tier

* 1 scan (no API key)
* Web-only

### Paid Tier (Launch)

**Price:** $25.67 / year
**Quota:**

* 1,000 API calls / month
* Rate limit: 5–10 requests / minute

### Enforcement

* Hard monthly cap
* 80% / 90% usage warnings
* 429 errors on quota exceeded

---

## 5. CI/CD & Automation Support (Critical)

### Supported Integrations (Day 1)

* `curl` / raw HTTP
* GitHub Actions
* Jenkins
* GitLab CI
* Replit
* Any LLM agent that can make HTTP calls

### Example Use Cases

* Post-deploy verification
* “Fail build if score < 80”
* AI agents checking their own output
* Scheduled production health checks

## 6. Differentiation (vs Lighthouse)

| Lighthouse          | TrifusedAI                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tool-centric        | API-first                      |
| Dev-focused         | Dev + AI-agent friendly        |
| Multi-metric output | Single normalized score + gate |
| Manual or scripted  | Designed for automation        |
| Google-owned        | Neutral / platform-agnostic    |

**Key Insight:**
TrifusedAI is a **decision signal**, not just a report.

## 7. Security & Abuse Prevention

* API keys per user
* Rate limiting
* Monthly quotas
* Key rotation & revocation
* Logging per request (key, time, URL hash)

---

## 8. MVP Success Metrics

* <2s response time (quick mode)
* ≥99.9% API uptime
* Successful CI/CD adoption
* Users embedding into build pipelines
* Paid conversion from free scan

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* GitHub Action (official)
* Webhook callbacks
* Score history per site
* Organization / agency plans
* AI-readable “fix hints”
* MCP-style agent-to-agent calls (optional)

---

If you want next:

* I can **write the OpenAPI spec**
* Create **GitHub Action YAML**
* Design **pricing tiers**
* Or help you position this as **“the final AI deployment gate”**

Just say the word.
