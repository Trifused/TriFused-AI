Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: SiteVision AI Auditor Version: 1.0 Date: December 23, 2025 Author: [Your Name/Team] Status: Draft
1. Overview & Purpose
SiteVision AI Auditor is a SaaS web application that provides instant, comprehensive website performance and accessibility audits. Users submit a website URL and receive:
	•	A detailed performance report powered by Google PageSpeed Insights (Lighthouse engine), including Core Web Vitals, scores, and optimization recommendations.
	•	AI-powered visual analysis of the rendered page screenshot, identifying accessibility issues (e.g., low contrast, tiny text, missing alt text on images, overlays blocking content, cookie banners) that standard HTML-based tools miss.
The product combines reliable, free third-party data with advanced AI vision capabilities to deliver deeper, more actionable insights than basic free graders—positioning it as a premium tool for agencies, freelancers, marketers, and web developers.
Why build this? Existing free tools (PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix) provide great data but lack rendered-page visual compliance checks. Paid tools charge $50–$300/month for similar aggregation + extras. SiteVision fills the gap with AI-enhanced reports at an accessible price point.
2. Goals & Objectives
	•	Business Goals:
	◦	Achieve 500 paying users in the first 12 months.
	◦	Generate recurring revenue through subscriptions.
	◦	Establish brand as an innovative AI-powered website health tool.
	•	Product Goals:
	◦	Deliver audits in under 10 seconds.
	◦	Provide reports that are 30% more insightful than Google PSI alone (via AI visual notes).
	◦	Ensure 100% compliance with third-party TOS (Google PSI commercial use allowed; AI vision on public screenshots).
	•	Success Metrics:
	◦	Conversion rate from free trial audits to paid subscription: >15%.
	◦	Monthly audit volume: 10,000+ in first 6 months.
	◦	NPS > 40 from user feedback.
	◦	Churn rate < 10% monthly.
	◦	Average report score accuracy validated against manual reviews.
3. Target Audience & User Personas
	•	Primary Users:
	◦	Digital agencies & SEO consultants (need white-labeled reports for clients).
	◦	Freelance web developers/designers (quick checks before launch).
	◦	Marketing teams (monitoring site health impacting conversions).
	◦	Small business owners (DIY optimization).
	•	Key Persona Example:
	◦	Alex, 32, freelance web dev: Runs 5–10 audits/week, needs fast visual accessibility flags to fix issues before client sign-off. Budget: $29–$99/month.
