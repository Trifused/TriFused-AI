## Issues Found (13):

### [SEO] Title length is 71 characters (recommended: 50-60) (important)
**Impact:** Titles that are too short or too long may be truncated in search results
**Fix:** Adjust your title to be between 50-60 characters for optimal display

### [SECURITY] Missing X-Content-Type-Options header (important)
**Impact:** Browsers might MIME-sniff content, leading to security issues
**Fix:** Add header: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

### [ACCESSIBILITY] 1 form input(s) missing labels (important)
**Impact:** Screen reader users won't know what to enter in these fields
**Fix:** Add <label for='inputId'> or aria-label attribute to each input field

### [ACCESSIBILITY] 1 element(s) with positive tabindex values (important)
**Impact:** Positive tabindex disrupts natural keyboard navigation order
**Fix:** Use tabindex='0' for focusable elements or tabindex='-1' to remove from tab order

### [KEYWORDS] Top keyword "support" not in title or H1 (important)
**Impact:** Main keywords should appear in title and H1 for better SEO
**Fix:** Include "support" naturally in your page title and H1 heading

### [MOBILE] JavaScript files may not be minified (optional)
**Impact:** Unminified JS can slow down mobile page loads on cellular networks
**Fix:** Minify your JavaScript files to reduce file size and improve load times

### [MOBILE] CSS files may not be minified (optional)
**Impact:** Unminified CSS can slow down mobile page loads on cellular networks
**Fix:** Minify your CSS files to reduce file size and improve load times

### [EMAIL] No MX records found (important)
**Impact:** Email cannot be received at this domain
**Fix:** Add MX records to your DNS configuration to receive emails

### [EMAIL] Missing SPF record (critical)
**Impact:** Emails may be marked as spam or spoofed
**Fix:** Add an SPF TXT record like: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

### [EMAIL] Missing DMARC policy (critical)
**Impact:** No policy for handling failed email authentication
**Fix:** Add a DMARC TXT record at _dmarc.yourdomain.com like: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com

### [EMAIL] No DKIM signature detected (important)
**Impact:** Emails cannot be verified as authentic
**Fix:** Configure DKIM with your email provider and add the public key to DNS

### [STRUCTURED-DATA] No JSON-LD structured data found (critical)
**Impact:** AI systems cannot understand your content structure, reducing discoverability
**Fix:** Add JSON-LD structured data using schema.org vocabulary

Example:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company",
  "url": "https://docs.stripe.com/mcp",
  "description": "Your company description"
}
</script>

### [MCP-COMPLIANCE] No MCP server endpoint detected (optional)
**Impact:** AI agents cannot interact with your site via Model Context Protocol
**Fix:** Consider implementing an MCP server for AI agent integration

Example:
// MCP discovery endpoint at /.well-known/mcp
{
  "name": "your-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tools": [{ "name": "your_tool", "description": "..." }]
