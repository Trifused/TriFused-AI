## Issues Found (15):

### [SEO] Meta description length is 178 characters (recommended: 150-160) (important)
**Impact:** Descriptions that are too short or long may not display optimally in search results
**Fix:** Adjust your meta description to be between 150-160 characters

### [SECURITY] Missing Content-Security-Policy header (important)
**Impact:** CSP helps prevent XSS attacks and data injection
**Fix:** Add a Content-Security-Policy header to your server configuration. Start with: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'

### [ACCESSIBILITY] 1 form input(s) missing labels (important)
**Impact:** Screen reader users won't know what to enter in these fields
**Fix:** Add <label for='inputId'> or aria-label attribute to each input field

### [ACCESSIBILITY] 2 link(s) without accessible text (important)
**Impact:** Screen reader users won't know where these links go
**Fix:** Add descriptive link text or aria-label to all links

### [ACCESSIBILITY] No skip navigation link found (optional)
**Impact:** Keyboard users must tab through all navigation on every page
**Fix:** Add a 'Skip to main content' link at the top of your page

### [KEYWORDS] Top keyword "absolute" not in title or H1 (important)
**Impact:** Main keywords should appear in title and H1 for better SEO
**Fix:** Include "absolute" naturally in your page title and H1 heading

### [KEYWORDS] Keyword "absolute" density is 5.3% (may be too high) (important)
**Impact:** Keyword stuffing can hurt SEO rankings
**Fix:** Reduce repetition of this keyword. Aim for 1-2% density

### [MOBILE] Small font sizes detected in inline styles (important)
**Impact:** Text smaller than 12px is difficult to read on mobile devices
**Fix:** Use a minimum font size of 16px for body text on mobile devices

### [MOBILE] JavaScript files may not be minified (optional)
**Impact:** Unminified JS can slow down mobile page loads on cellular networks
**Fix:** Minify your JavaScript files to reduce file size and improve load times

### [MOBILE] CSS files may not be minified (optional)
**Impact:** Unminified CSS can slow down mobile page loads on cellular networks
**Fix:** Minify your CSS files to reduce file size and improve load times

### [MOBILE] Only 44% of images have width/height attributes (important)
**Impact:** Missing dimensions cause layout shift (CLS) which hurts mobile UX and Core Web Vitals
**Fix:** Add width and height attributes to all <img> tags to prevent layout shift

### [STRUCTURED-DATA] No JSON-LD structured data found (critical)
**Impact:** AI systems cannot understand your content structure, reducing discoverability
**Fix:** Add JSON-LD structured data using schema.org vocabulary

Example:
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company",
  "url": "https://www.firecrawl.dev/",
  "description": "Your company description"
}
</script>

### [MCP-COMPLIANCE] No MCP server endpoint detected (optional)
**Impact:** AI agents cannot interact with your site via Model Context Protocol
**Fix:** Consider implementing an MCP server for AI agent integration

Example:
// MCP discovery endpoint at /.well-known/mcp
{
  "name": "your-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tools": [{ "name": "your_tool", "description": "..." }]
}

### [CRAWLABILITY] robots.txt may be blocking all crawlers (important)
**Impact:** AI systems may not be able to access your content
**Fix:** Review your robots.txt rules to ensure desired pages are accessible

### [CRAWLABILITY] No sitemap reference in robots.txt (optional)
